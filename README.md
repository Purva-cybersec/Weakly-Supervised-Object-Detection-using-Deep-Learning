# Weakly-Supervised-Object-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This repository contains my work on weakly supervised deep object detection, showcasing an implementation in Jupyter Notebook and an accompanying presentation. The project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to object detection tasks using limited supervision.

## Contents
1. **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`):**
   - Contains the implementation of weakly supervised deep object detection.
   - Includes detailed explanations of the methodology and results.
   - Demonstrates the use of deep learning frameworks and libraries for efficient object detection.

2. **Presentation:**
   - Summarizes the key aspects of the project.
   - Provides an overview of the methodology, challenges, and outcomes.
   - Designed to communicate findings effectively to a broad audience.

## Features
